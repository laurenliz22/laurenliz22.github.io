Here I sit about to complete my 5 month immersive course in Data Science with the Flatiron School this week!  Before I leave this course, I want to speak about why I decided to enter this field and change my profession at age 36.

Before I entered the Data Science world, I worked as a Pension Actuary for 11+ years.  I was a consultant and moved my way through 2 very successful companies in New York City.  Working in the corporate world as a consultant in NYC was very exciting at first.  As an actuary I was able to use probability and statistics to analyze datasets from my clients and make sure they were complient with IRS regulations.  I also worked on projects where I was able to come up with interesting design alternatives using various parameters to produce results that could be more cost effective for my clients.  I worked in an office with people who became great friends, and are my friends to this day.  

As my career progressed it turned more into a project management/sales type of role.  I realize this is typical in consulting as companies rely on clients to make money and therefore bringing in revenue and managing people and projects becomes a key aspect of that.  I was desperately trying to become the type of employee that succeeded at my company for years.  Eventually, I had a revelation that what I was working so hard at trying to become was not actually who I wanted to be.  I missed doing the work over reviewing the work.  I missed using my math and analytical skills to problem solve over managing others to do so.  I missed sitting down and crunching the numbers over traveling and presenting the numbers.  

With this revelation I decided to job search.

As I was job searching I was able to take a step back and really look at what I wanted to do with my life.  In doing so, I knew that I wanted a few things out of my career.  I wanted a position where I was able to use my analytical and problem solving skillset using math.  I wanted a position at a company where I felt like I was making a difference in the world, be that through a new innovative product or bettering our current world.  I wanted a career where I could work in an office environment with others (I was working remotely before) and I wanted a career where I could limit my amount of travel (as a consultant you really travel a lot).  

While I was looking at jobs and talking to friends of mine, I realized that the world of Data Science could tick off all of the items I wanted in my next career!  I had a couple of options on how to pursue the world of Data Science from obtaining a job with no training to self teaching to taking a part time course, etc.  I decided in the end since I wanted to leave my current position that the best course of action I could take was to save up  and take a full time course in Data Science to really learn the skills in an immersive program.  After doing a bit of research, the Flatiron School ticked off all of my boxes and I began my course in August. 

It's been a very rewarding 5 months and I feel incredibly lucky I had this opportunity!
